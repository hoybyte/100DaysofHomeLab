# Home Lab Journal

## Day 001: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I went through old hardware and determined the best candidate for proxmox. I downloaded the ISO and placed it on my Ventoy USB. I will install Proxmox tomorrow and setup network configuration for our network. Additionally, I will add an additional network adapter to assist with VMs interferring with on board NIC. 

**Thoughts**: I am thrilled to use existing hardware to setup a better homelab.
